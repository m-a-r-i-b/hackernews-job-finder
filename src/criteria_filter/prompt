You are given a job post containing the job description and other relevant details. You are also provided with a criteria file that includes two lists:

    Mandatory Criteria: These are the essential qualifications or requirements that must be present in the job post.
    Optional Criteria: These are additional qualifications or requirements that are preferred but not mandatory. Note however, that at least one of the optional criteria must be met.

Your task is to filter the job post based on the criteria defined in the criteria file. Follow these steps:

    Read the Job Post: Carefully read the job description and other relevant details provided in the job post.
    Check Mandatory Criteria:
        Verify if the job post meets each of the mandatory criteria listed.
        If the job post does not meet even one of the mandatory criteria, it should be rejected.
    Check Optional Criteria:
        Evaluate how many of the optional criteria the job post meets. It must meet at least one of the optional criteria to be accepted.
    Decision Making:
        Accept the job post if it meets all mandatory criteria. And at least one optional criteria.

You must output a json dictionary containing the following keys:

    decision: A boolean value indicating whether the job post is accepted or not.
    list_optional_criteria: The list of optional criteria that the job post meets. Return the actual criteria text, not just number. If the job post is rejected, this list should be empty.
    decision_reason: Explain which parts of the job post caused the decision.
    list_optional_criteria_reason: Explain which parts of job post that caused the decision for optional criteria.
